Here are some useful commands to remember.

```sh
npm i                   # install dependencies
git checkout -b draft   # switch to the draft branch before starting

git add -A              # add a changed file to the staging area
git commit -m 'message' # create a commit with the changes
git push                # push the new commit to the remote repo
```
## Question 1

Read the documentation for `findIndex` and `indexOf` on MDN:
- [findIndex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)
- [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf). 

Explain the difference between the methods and explain when you would choose one over the other. Provide examples to enhance your response.
